# simply-politico


## Project Overview
### Features
- Will have a place to enter zip code that will allow user to see candidates and ballot measures they are able to vote on.
- Will only do Oregon/Washington
- Will also allow people to look up issues that they are interested in to see which candidates are for or against them.
### What I am trying to solve
- It is attempting to make it easier for people to find information on political matters that mean something to them.
### Libraries and Framworks
- Django
- Materilize
- Pro Publica API's

## Functionality

The Page will start with a screen explaining what the website is about. It will then have a place for the user to input information about where they live and some political issues they are interested in learning about. With the things they enter and click the site will find information on the people currently in office and the people that are challinging them. It will find statements that they have made one way or another about the issues they click on and also find ballot intiatives that have to do with those things as well.

## Data Model
- Will need public statements made by candidates and incumbents.
- Will need ballot initiative information.
- Will need to know geographic information about how counties, states, and cities are broken up.


## Schedule

### First Week
- Get all relevent API's and/or data dumps set up to automatically update or being able to be called.
### Second Week
- Tweek inputs so that user's can affect data on the backend through api calls or through database lookups.
### Third and Forth Week
- Make it pretty and iron out any tweeks that arise.
### Beyond
- Expand to include the whole US or even expand to look at foreign policies.
